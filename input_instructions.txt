Please input the dimensions of the matrix

Remeber that the syntax mxn reffers to 
m = # of rows and n = # of columns

For example, the matrix
	
	1  2  3
	2  1  0

is a 2x3 matrix

***************************
please include the augmented column in these calculations

ie: 
	1 2 | 3
	2 1 | 4

would be considered 2x3 for the purposes of this query

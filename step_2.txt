
Now, all entries above and/ or bellow the pivot '1' 
need to be reduced to '0'

This is done using row opperations

Since 1 x any number = that number,
and a number - itself = 0

We need to temporarily multiply the pivot '1''s row
by the number above or below it that needs to be reduced to '0'

This will make the pivot temporarily equal to the number we're reducing to '0'

To finish reducing the number to 0, we need to subtract the temporarily 
scaled row from the row with the entry needing to be reduced to '0'
